Below are the list of Algorithms implemented:
1. Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
Time Complexity: O(N2)
2. Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
Time Complexity: O(N2)
3. Selection Sort: The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
Time Complexity: O(N2)
4. Merge Sort: The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
Time Complexity: Nlog(N)
5. Quick Sort: QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
Time Complexity: Nlog(N) 
6. Count Sort: Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then do some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence. 
Time Complexity: O(N)
